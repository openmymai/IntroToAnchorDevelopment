## Intro to Anchor Development

- **Programs** on Solana have **instruction handlers**, which are functions that take arguments from incoming instructions. They are the entry point for any operation in a program.
- **Rust** is the most common language for building Solana programs. The **Anchor** framework takes care of common grunt work - like reading data from incoming instructions, and checking the right accounts are provided - so you can focus on building your Solana program.
